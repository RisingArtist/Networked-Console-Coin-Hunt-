# Networked-Console-Coin-Hunt

A small socket programming console game made in C# for a Game Development assignment to learn more about syncing data to players. This 
helped us prepare to learn about Unity's Networking System (UNET) and their way of syncing. Not confident to say this, if I remember 
correctly, the way the player data gets sync across the network is similar to how Unity's SyncVar works. At this point in time, it's been a few years since I last touch UNET but looking forward to see how it goes with Unity 2020. 

It was streamed for approx. 9 hours (or more) overnight on my Twitch channel and it was fun to interact with the viewers at the time. 

How to setup:
To Start a Server
Run the application
When prompt, Enter '0' to start a server 

To start (add) as a player
Open another instance of the application by opening up the .exe file
When prompt again, Enter 1 to join as a client. 
You can repeat to add another player to the game.
